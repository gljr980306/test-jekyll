<p><strong>Name:</strong>  Chelonia mydas</p>
<p><strong>Length:</strong>  80-150 cm</p>
<p><strong>weight</strong>   65-136 kg</p>
<p><strong>Brief Introduction:</strong>  
    The green turtle is one of the largest hard-shelled sea turtles. It gets its name from the fact that its fat is green.
    Like other turtles, green turtles spend most of their lives in the sea, but they retain some of their ancestral lifestyle, so they return to land to breed, creating a unique lifestyle.
    The retractable head will be stuck, so the head cannot be completely retracted into the shell.
