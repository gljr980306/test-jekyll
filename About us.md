Website description
The Ocean Eye is an island in a mysterious part of The Pacific Ocean surrounded by lovely sea creatures. Our inspiration comes from "The room of requirement" in Harry Potter. Unlike any other aquarium in the word, The Ocean Eye is landed in an island in the middle of nowhere. Surrounded by sea, the Ocean Eye Island is blessed by abundant water resources. Long Known as the most mysterious aquarium, The Ocean Eye has fostered a unique culture. For example, all the introduced species here have right to live freely in the water around the island, and reasonable predation is allowed. Our official home page will include brief introduction of the community of The Ocean Eye. 
In order to let more people knowing its existence, passing its beauty to more people as well as letting people in fatigue can get a trace of spiritual comfort. We set up this website, to introduce you to the beautiful creatures around the island, but also hold some interesting activities on a regular basis. We have “beautiful angles” , “Big Fellas”, “The Cold-bloods”, “Agile Swimmer”and “Tuck& Roller”, five main topics to introduce different types of marine life.
